# Odin-Signup-Form
A project from TOP curriculum to practice creating forms, client-side validation, and styling.

Note 2023/01/03:
I think my form looks decent currently. There are various areas of improvement, but I do not want to spend more time on the form at the moment. 
Imrpovements for future reference:
- Media Querry for small screens:
>> reduce row gap
>> use narrower photo or rotate ODIN photo 90 deg and align it vertically with the form
>> reduce font size of the larger text
>> improve responsiveness in general 

- Implement password matching validation: 
>> I think I may do that while after/learning server-side validation

- Improve my understanding of regular expression 
>> This is not specific to this project, but can be applied to the form patterns (e.g., restrict name to alphabet, a dash and a symbol)
